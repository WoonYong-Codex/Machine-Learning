Handling Customer Churn For a multinational Bank

**Scenario:** You work at a multinational bank that is aiming to increase it's market share in 
Europe. Recently, it has been noticed that the number of customers using the banking 
services has declined, and the bank is worried that existing customers have stopped 
using them as their main bank. <br> 

As a data scientist, you are tasked with finding out the 
reasons behind customer churn (when a customer stops using them as the main bank) and to predict customer churn. <br> 

The marketing team, 
in particular, is interested in your findings and want to better understand existing 
customer behavior and possibly predict customer churn. Your results will help the 
marketing team to use their budget wisely to target potential churners. To achieve 
this objective, in this exercise, you will import the banking data (Churn_Modelling.csv) 
provided by the bank and do some machine learning to solve their problem.
